This project contains data that was collected and measured by the World Health Organization. 
The data compares hypertension and cholesterol level values in Canada overtime along with ranking the country compared to the rest of the world (as it is my home country). 
The notebook contains links to the datasets, data cleaning, and converting the data to SQL tables for the data extraction as well as discussion paragraphs explaining the approach to the code and the thought process.
This analysis was completed for a group project and my responsibilites included answering the following questions: "How does cholesterol levels influence the prevalence of hypertension? How do these factors correlate to the numbers of deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease?".
This project was important as factors such as hypertension and cholesterol relates to non-communicable diseases. Exploring the trends and ranking of these factors can evaluate what is happening within 
the Canadian population.
